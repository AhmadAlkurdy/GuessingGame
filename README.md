# GuessingGame
an application that plays "guess the number" as follows:  Your program chooses
the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer in the range 1 to 1000.  
The application displays the prompt "Guess a number between 1 and 1000."   The 
player inputs a first guess.  If the player's guess is incorrect, your program
should display "Too high.  Try again."  Or "Too low.  Try again."  to help the 
player zero in on the correct answer.  The program should prompt the user for 
the next guess.  When the user enters the correct answer, display "Congratulations,
you guessed the number!", and allow the user to choose whether to play agin.  
[Note: The guessing technique employed in this problem is similar to a binary search]
